homegit: Track $HOME.
---------------------

* Selectively track "dot files" in $HOME with git.
* Ignore all untracked files (so that `git status` is concise).
* Avoid being found by git when called in a subdirectory of $HOME

To bootstrap:

    curl -sSL qwerty.sh | sh -s - -o - \
        https://github.com/rduplain/home.git .bootstrap.bash | exec bash -s -

Launching a new shell provides the `homegit` command which provides the
configuration for git to find the .homegit directory from any working
directory. Note that git walks the current working directory looking for a
.git directory, so use `homegit` and .homegit to avoid unintentional git
commands against the home directory.

Some useful $HOME files are not tracked here; transfer these as needed.
