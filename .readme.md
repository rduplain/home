homegit: Track $HOME.
---------------------

Summary:

* Track $HOME "dot files" in place with git.
* Ignore all untracked files (so that `git status` is concise).
* Avoid being found by git when called in a subdirectory of $HOME.

Track $HOME files in place using git. Configuration is specific to
[@rduplain](https://github.com/rduplain) and is available here for public
review (the primary purpose) and forking (which is certainly possible but
unexpected).

Because `git` walks all parent directories to find a `.git` subdirectory,
tracking $HOME files with git requires indirection. As such, $HOME files are
tracked in a non-standard `.homegit` directory. This way, calling `git` from
`$HOME/path/to/whatever` does not find `$HOME/.homegit`. To use this
repository, the `homegit` executable provides a way to interact with
`$HOME/.homegit`, and configuration is set to ignore untracked files, given
that the vast majority of $HOME consists of documents, source repositories, and
private configuration. Further, the `git` command is wrapped (`$HOME/bin/git`)
to use `$HOME/.homegit` when invoked from the $HOME directory, as to make `git`
"just work" based on the working directory.

To bootstrap:

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://qwerty.sh | sh -s - -o - \
      https://github.com/rduplain/home.git .bootstrap.bash | exec bash -s -

As part of several steps, this sets git to only show tracked files in $HOME:

    git config --add status.showUntrackedFiles no

Some useful $HOME files are not tracked here, because they are private.
Transfer these as needed.
