homegit: Track $HOME.
---------------------

Summary:

* Track $HOME "dot files" in place with git.
* Ignore all untracked files (so that `git status` is concise).
* Avoid being found by git when called in a subdirectory of $HOME.

Configuration is specific to [@rduplain](https://github.com/rduplain) and is
available here for public review (the primary purpose) and forking (which is
certainly possible but unexpected).

Because `git` walks all parent directories to find a `.git` subdirectory,
tracking $HOME files with git requires indirection. $HOME files are tracked in
a non-standard `.homegit` directory. This way, calling `git` from
`$HOME/path/to/whatever` does not find `$HOME/.homegit` (and there's no
`$HOME/.git`).

To use this repository, the `homegit` executable provides a way to interact
with `$HOME/.homegit`, and configuration is set to ignore untracked files,
given that the vast majority subdirectories of $HOME consist of documents,
source repositories, and private configuration. Further, the `git` command is
wrapped (`$HOME/bin/git`) to use `$HOME/.homegit` when invoked from the $HOME
directory, as to make `git` "just work" based on the working directory.

To bootstrap:

```sh
qwerty_sh="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rduplain/qwerty.sh/v0.7/qwerty.sh"
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf $qwerty_sh | sh -s - \
 -o - https://github.com/rduplain/home.git .bootstrap.bash | exec bash -s -
```

On an existing clone:

    ~/.bootstrap.bash

As part of several steps, this sets git to only show tracked files in $HOME:

    git config --add status.showUntrackedFiles no

Some useful $HOME files are not tracked here, because they are private.
