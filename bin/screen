# * default the sessionname to the basename of $PWD.

# SCREENRC and SCREENRC_DEFAULT variables:
#
# SCREENRC is configuring what GNU screen calls it's rc file.
#
# Below, you'll see that this wrapper looks for a project-local .screenrc which
# is expected to source $HOME/.screenrc.  If no local .screenrc is found, use
# $SCREENRC_DEFAULT, which is $HOME/.screenrc, unless you set the
# SCREENRC_DEFAULT env variable to some rc file which provides a nice set of
# windows which you'd like to have on each project.
#
# See ~/.screenrc-default in the repository containing this wrapper.

# Build a string of options & arguments to inject into screen command call.
