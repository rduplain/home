# I was looking for a way to have screen run program at start then run a shell.

if [ "$1" = "-C" ]; then
   cd $2
   shift 2

# hack, but it works:
# run echo from PROMPT_COMMAND to put info in title bar
echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME} ${PWD/$HOME/~}\007"

# run the requested command
$@

# hack, but it works:
# put command in history before executing shell
# need unambiguous redirect, so hard-coded .bash_history
[[ -n "$@" ]] && echo "$@" >> $HOME/.bash_history

# now launch shell
exec $SHELL
