#!/bin/bash
# I was looking for a way to have screen run program at start then run a shell.

# Ideally, we would use $SHELL instead of bash-isms.
# HACK: want to set environment before running command:
. "$HOME"/.bashrc

if [ "$1" = "-C" ]; then
   cd $2
   shift 2
fi

# HACK: (but it works)
# run echo from PROMPT_COMMAND to put info in title bar
echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME} ${PWD/$HOME/~}\007"

# run the requested command
$@

# HACK: (but it works)
# put command in history before executing shell
# need unambiguous redirect, so hard-coded .bash_history
[[ -n "$@" ]] && echo "$@" >> $HOME/.bash_history

# now launch shell
exec /bin/bash
